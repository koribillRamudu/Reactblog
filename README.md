##Components Struture

1. BlogPost: in this component represents an individual blog post. it will display the title,author,date, read time and content of single post.

2. BlogList: This component acts as a container for multiple BlogPost components. It receives an array of posts as props and maps through them to render each individual blog post.

3.Header: the component is use to navigation and displaying the site title.


##styling Approach

 I used CSS Modules, which helps keep the styles separate for each component. This means that the styles are specific to each part of the app and won’t mix with other components, making the code easier to manage.

 ##New Features

1.created a blog post component that dynamically displays the blog post details
2.created a blog list component that render a list of posts dynamically for the array of posts

3.created a posts in that which contains the post infromation.
